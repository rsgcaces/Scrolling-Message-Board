# RSGC ACES: Message Board

![Message Board](images/DESMessageBoard.jpg)

## Beginnings
As a Grade 10 student, O. Logush  agreed to develop the code of a message board to be located over the door of the DES. I would develop the hardware.
Here's what we came up with in the Spring of 2016 [Message Board](http://darcy.rsgc.on.ca/ACES/PCBs/index.html#ScrollingMessageBoard).

## Components

### Arduino UNO
Each of two players provides their own Arduino UNO and cable, capable of displaying content to his Serial Monitor.
